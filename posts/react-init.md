#Setting Up React
##05/31/2019

I just wanted to say, ReactJS is awesome, and it is really easy to get started. From the Facebook github page:

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start
```

Npx is a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+
The first line installs the needed react modules, along with setting up the workspace correctly
The third line starts up the node server, accessible at localhost:3000, unless the port is changed.

:)
